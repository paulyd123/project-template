## Introduction
For thi project I had to design a neo4j graph database which consisted of the constituencies in the Republic of Ireland and also the candidates that ran in thoe constituencies. I also had to create a relationship between them the candidates and the constituencies.

## Database

Then explain them one by one in the following sections.
